DOCUMENT 3: Witness Statement - Neighbor

Statement of John Smith, neighbor at 125 Main Street.

I live next door to the Johnson family. On the evening of January 15, 2024, I heard loud arguing coming from their house around 3:00 PM. The voices sounded angry and there was some shouting.

I heard what sounded like glass breaking, followed by a woman's voice crying. I considered calling the police but decided to wait and see if things calmed down.

About 20 minutes later, I saw a man (who I believe was Mr. Johnson) leave the house quickly and drive away in a silver sedan. He appeared to be upset.

I did not see Mrs. Johnson at any point during this incident. The house became quiet after the man left.

I have lived next to the Johnsons for 3 years and this is the first time I've heard anything like this from their home. They seem like a normal couple otherwise.
