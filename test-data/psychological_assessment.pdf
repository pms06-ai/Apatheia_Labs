DOCUMENT 4: Expert Psychological Assessment

Assessment Report: Johnson Family Case
Prepared by: Dr. Emily Carter, Clinical Psychologist
Date: January 20, 2024

SUBJECT: Sarah Johnson
AGE: 38
OCCUPATION: Elementary School Teacher

HISTORY:
Mrs. Johnson reports a history of marital difficulties spanning the past 5 years. She describes her husband as controlling and occasionally verbally abusive. She mentions three specific incidents of physical altercations, the most recent occurring on January 15, 2024.

During the January 15 incident, Mrs. Johnson states that Mr. Johnson became enraged during a discussion about financial matters. She reports that he grabbed her arm tightly, leaving bruises, and threw a lamp against the wall. She also mentions that their 8-year-old daughter was present in the home during the incident.

Mrs. Johnson expresses fear for her safety and that of her child. She reports that Mr. Johnson has threatened to take the child away from her if she seeks help.

CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS:
During the assessment, Mrs. Johnson appeared anxious but cooperative. She provided detailed accounts of the incidents and showed visible signs of emotional distress. There were no indications of substance abuse or mental health issues that would invalidate her report.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Given the reported history of abuse and current safety concerns, I recommend:
1. Immediate protective measures for Mrs. Johnson and her child
2. Court-ordered restraining order against Mr. Johnson
3. Family court intervention regarding child custody arrangements
4. Couples counseling (once safety is ensured)

This assessment is based on self-reported information and clinical observation. Further investigation may be warranted.
