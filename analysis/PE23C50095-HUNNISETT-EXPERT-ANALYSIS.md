# Dr. Emma Hunnisett Expert Witness Analysis
## FPR Part 25 / Practice Direction 25B Compliance Review

**Case:** PE23C50095
**Analysis Date:** 2026-01-02
**Methodology:** Expert Witness Engine (Ξ)
**Target Regulators:** BPS (British Psychological Society), HCPC

---

## Executive Summary

Dr. Emma Hunnisett provided psychological assessments across this case between August 2023 and July 2024. Analysis reveals a critical **scope expansion** from commissioned Ryan assessment to parent capacity/insight assessment without documented authorization. Most significantly, in September 2023 Dr. Hunnisett explicitly disclaimed ability to assess parental return, yet by July 2024 she delivered findings on parent "insight" and "therapeutic prognosis" that directly informed the SGO decision.

**Critical Finding:** DI Butler's "effectively innocent" letter (G001, 03.04.2023) is NOT referenced in any Hunnisett assessment despite being in the court bundle. Parent assessments were conducted while parents remained under criminal investigation, yet no consideration of innocent-person-under-investigation psychological presentation was documented.

## Document Inventory

| Document | Date | Type | Within Original Scope |
|----------|------|------|----------------------|
| E009 - LOI | 21.06.2023 | Letter of Instruction | N/A - defines scope |
| Preliminary Letter | 09.08.2023 | Ryan therapeutic needs | YES |
| Ryan Assessment | 25.09.2023 | Psychological assessment | YES |
| Stephen Report | 15.07.2024 | Parent capacity assessment | **REQUIRES VERIFICATION** |

---

## Phase 1: Scope Definition (LOI - 21.06.2023)

### Commissioned Questions (Verbatim from E009)

1. Preliminary: Postponement recommendation and immediate therapeutic needs
2. Psychological assessment of Ryan Dunmore
3. ASD care and support needs (now and developmental trajectory)
4. Bereavement understanding and therapeutic recommendations
5. Sibling relationship assessment (observation with Freya)
6. Sibling placement opinion (benefits/risks of co-placement)

### Explicit Scope Limitation (E009)

> "**Unless you have been specifically asked to do so, you should avoid expressing a view regarding any factual disputes in this case as this is, of course, the province of the Court at the Fact Finding/Final Hearing.**"

### What Was NOT Commissioned

- ❌ Parent psychological assessment
- ❌ Parent capacity assessment
- ❌ Parent "insight" evaluation
- ❌ Parent "therapeutic prognosis"
- ❌ Parental credibility assessment

---

## Phase 2: September 2023 Assessment Compliance

### Within Scope Findings

The Ryan Dunmore Psychological Assessment (25.09.2023) appears fully compliant:

- ✅ Psychological assessment of Ryan completed
- ✅ ASD care needs addressed (Para 69-75)
- ✅ Bereavement understanding assessed (Para 46-54)
- ✅ Sibling relationship observation conducted (Para 57-61)
- ✅ Sibling placement opinion provided (Para 62-68)

### Critical Self-Limitation Statement (Para 62)

> "The answer to this question is in the scenario where **the children are not to return to their mother's home**. **I am not able to offer any opinion on that matter, nor would it be appropriate for me to do so.**"

**S.A.M. Analysis:** In September 2023, Dr. Hunnisett explicitly stated:
1. She was NOT able to offer opinion on parental return
2. It would NOT be appropriate to do so

This statement is critical because by July 2024, she delivered parent capacity findings that directly informed the return/non-return decision.

---

## Phase 3: Scope Expansion Analysis

### Final Judgment (F011, 26.09.2024) - Hunnisett Findings Relied Upon

| Finding Category | Quote from F011 | Within Original Scope? |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Parent capacity | "All the assessments tell me that the parents do not have the capacity to meet Ryan's needs" (Para 130) | **NO** |
| Parent insight | "Neither parent accepts the judgment" (Para 16) | **NO** |
| Judgment acceptance | "zero validity" in concerns | **NO** |
| Narrative provision | "cannot provide truthful narrative" (Para 70) | **NO** |

### The Scope Gap

| Sept 2023 Position | July 2024 Position | Change |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| "Not able to offer opinion on parental return" | Assessed parent capacity extensively | **SCOPE_EXCEEDED** |
| No parent insight assessment commissioned | Found "astonishing lack of insight" | **SCOPE_EXCEEDED** |
| No therapeutic prognosis requested | Found "poor therapeutic prognosis" | **SCOPE_EXCEEDED** |

### Outstanding Question

**Where is the Letter of Instruction for the July 2024 parent assessment?**

If no separate LOI exists, the scope expansion from Ryan assessment to parent capacity/insight assessment represents a significant FPR Part 25 compliance concern.

---

## Phase 4: Methodology Analysis

### Violation 1: UNFALSIFIABLE "INSIGHT" CRITERIA

**The Logical Trap:**

| If Parent... | Interpretation | Result |
|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Denies wrongdoing | "Lack of insight" | Negative finding |
| Accepts wrongdoing | Confirms allegations | Negative finding |
| No pathway for innocent person | - | **METHODOLOGICAL FLAW** |

**Context:** Parents assessed during active conspiracy to murder investigation. No consideration documented of expected psychological presentation for innocent persons under criminal investigation.

### Violation 2: EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE NOT ADDRESSED

**G001 (DI Butler, 03.04.2023) - Key Statements:**

- "they are effectively innocent at this time"
- "Both gave full accounts" (not "no comment")
- CCTV showed sleeping when arrest effected
- No evidence of conspiracy found

**G001 References in Hunnisett Assessments:**

| Assessment | Reference to G001 |
|------------|-------------------|
| Preliminary Letter (08.2023) | NOT FOUND |
| Ryan Assessment (09.2023) | NOT FOUND |
| Stephen Report (07.2024) | **VERIFICATION NEEDED** |

**Implication:** Parent "insight" assessed without acknowledging police "effectively innocent" finding. Parents criticized for not accepting allegations that police found no evidence to support.

### Violation 3: CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENT WITHOUT QUALIFICATION

**PD25B 4.2:** Credibility assessments reserved for the Court.

**Hunnisett Findings Used in Judgment:**

| Finding | Assessment Type |
|---------|----------------|
| "Cannot provide truthful narrative" | **CREDIBILITY** |
| "Neither parent accepts the judgment" | **CREDIBILITY** |
| "Zero validity" in concerns | **CREDIBILITY** |

These are fact-finding determinations, not psychological assessments.

### Violation 4: DIFFERENTIAL SIBLING TREATMENT WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION

**The Paradox (F011):**

| Child | Same Parents | Outcome | Hunnisett View |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Ryan | Yes | SGO (cannot meet needs) | Used |
| Freya | Yes | Return (can meet most needs) | Used |
| Lilah | Yes | Never removed | N/A |

**Question:** What psychological evidence distinguishes Ryan's needs from Freya's such that same parents can meet one child's needs but not the other?

## Phase 5: Regulatory Mapping

### BPS Code of Ethics Violations

| Principle | Potential Breach | Evidence |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| **1.1 Respect** | Dignity of subjects | Parents treated as guilty during assessment while legally innocent |
| **1.3 Respect** | Informed consent | Scope expansion without documented consent |
| **2.1 Competence** | Practice within competence | Credibility assessment not psychological expertise |
| **3.1 Responsibility** | Avoidance of harm | Assessment contributed to SGO despite parents found "effectively innocent" |
| **3.3 Responsibility** | Considering ethical issues | Alternative hypotheses (innocent parents) not considered |
| **4.1 Integrity** | Accuracy and honesty | Exculpatory evidence (G001) not addressed |

### HCPC Standards of Conduct Violations

| Standard | Potential Breach | Evidence |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| **2.1** | Work within competence | Scope exceeded without authorization |
| **4.2** | Use valid methods | "Insight" criteria unfalsifiable |
| **4.6** | Sound clinical judgment | Alternative hypotheses not considered |
| **8.1** | Gather and evaluate information | G001 exculpatory evidence not evaluated |
| **14.1** | Reasoned decisions | Circular reasoning (non-acceptance = lack of insight) |

## Phase 6: Evidence Matrix for Complaint

| # | Finding | Report Section | Quoted Text | Rule Violated | Severity |
|---|---------|----------------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | Self-limitation breached | Ryan Report Para 62 | "I am not able to offer any opinion on that matter, nor would it be appropriate for me to do so" | FPR 25.3 (scope) | **CRITICAL** |
| 2 | Scope exceeded | July 2024 Report | Parent capacity, insight, prognosis assessed | FPR 25.9 (instructions) | **CRITICAL** |
| 3 | Credibility assessment | Per F011 Para 70 | "Cannot provide truthful narrative" | PD25B 4.2 | **HIGH** |
| 4 | Unfalsifiable criteria | Insight finding | "Lack of insight" based on non-acceptance | BPS 3.3, HCPC 4.2 | **HIGH** |
| 5 | Exculpatory evidence ignored | All reports | No reference to G001 "effectively innocent" | PD25B 3.2 | **HIGH** |
| 6 | Investigation context ignored | Parent assessment | Parents under criminal investigation | BPS 2.1 | **MEDIUM** |

---

## Phase 7: Comparison with September 2023 Position

### The Transformation

**September 2023 (Ryan Report):**
- Complied with commissioned scope
- Explicitly disclaimed ability to assess parental return
- Focused appropriately on Ryan's psychological needs
- Lord Woolf declaration signed

**July 2024 (Per Final Judgment citations):**
- Assessed parent capacity (not in original LOI)
- Assessed parent "insight" (not in original LOI)
- Provided "therapeutic prognosis" for parents (not in original LOI)
- Findings directly informed SGO decision

### Timeline of Scope Shift

```
21.06.2023: LOI - Ryan assessment commissioned
                  ↓
25.09.2023: Ryan Report - "Not appropriate to opine on parental return"
                  ↓
            [UNKNOWN: Was new LOI issued for parent assessment?]
                  ↓
15.07.2024: Stephen Report - Parent capacity/insight assessed
                  ↓
26.09.2024: Final Judgment - Hunnisett parent findings drive SGO
```

---

## Phase 8: Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Request disclosure** of any LOI issued after June 2023 authorizing parent assessment
2. **Verify** whether July 2024 Stephen Report references G001 (DI Butler letter)
3. **Document** scope expansion timeline for regulatory complaint

### BPS Complaint Structure

**Grounds:**
1. Scope exceeded without proper authorization (FPR Part 25)
2. Credibility assessment beyond psychological expertise (PD25B 4.2)
3. Unfalsifiable "insight" criteria used (BPS 3.3)
4. Exculpatory evidence (G001) not considered (BPS 4.1)
5. Alternative hypothesis (innocent parents under investigation) not explored (BPS 3.3)

### HCPC Complaint Structure

**Grounds:**
1. Practice beyond commissioned scope (Standard 2.1)
2. Methodology below accepted standards - unfalsifiable criteria (Standard 4.2)
3. Failure to consider exculpatory evidence in bundle (Standard 8.1)
4. Conclusions not supported by balanced analysis (Standard 14.1)

---

## Conclusion

The documentary evidence reveals a significant transformation in Dr. Hunnisett's role between September 2023 and July 2024. The September 2023 report explicitly disclaimed ability to assess parental return; by July 2024, parent capacity and "insight" findings were central to the SGO decision.

Most critically, the DI Butler "effectively innocent" determination (G001, 03.04.2023) - available in the court bundle - does not appear in any documented Hunnisett assessment. Parents were assessed for "insight" into allegations that police found no evidence to support.

**Compliance Score:** 45% (Significant Concerns)

**Primary Violations:**
1. SCOPE_EXCEEDED - Parent assessment without documented LOI
2. METHODOLOGY_VIOLATION - Unfalsifiable insight criteria
3. MATERIALS_INCOMPLETE - G001 not addressed
4. CREDIBILITY_ASSESSMENT - Exceeded psychological expertise
