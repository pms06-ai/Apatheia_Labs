# PE23C50095 FACT-FINDING JUDGMENT - OMISSION ANALYSIS
## Material Omissions Using 5-Category Framework

**Document Analyzed:** Fact-Finding Judgment, HHJ Gordon-Saker
**Date:** 15 March 2024
**Hearing:** 26 Feb - 6 Mar 2024 (7 days)
**Methodology:** Omission Detection Engine (S.A.M. Framework)
**Framework:** 5-Category Omission Classification

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Analysis of the 117-paragraph Fact-Finding Judgment reveals **8 material omissions** where available evidence favorable to the parents was either not addressed or minimally referenced without proper weight. All 8 omissions are **PROSECUTION-FAVORING** (directionally biased against parents).

**Directional Bias Score:** +1.0 (8 prosecution-favoring / 0 defense-favoring = 100% one-directional)

**Statistical Significance:** p < 0.004 (binomial test, 8/8 directional outcome)

---

## OMISSION CATEGORIES DEFINED

1. **EXCULPATORY** - Evidence favoring parents not addressed
2. **CONTEXTUAL** - Missing context that would change interpretation
3. **PROCEDURAL** - Process failures not acknowledged
4. **TEMPORAL** - Timeline gaps or missing sequences
5. **CONTRADICTING** - Evidence contradicting findings not addressed

---

## MATERIAL OMISSIONS IDENTIFIED

### OMISSION 1: DI Butler's "Effectively Innocent" Finding

**Category:** EXCULPATORY
**Direction:** Prosecution-favoring
**Materiality:** CRITICAL

**Source Document:** G001 (DI Butler Letter, 03.04.2023)

**What Was Available:**
> "I believe it was the right decision to NFA, given they are **effectively innocent** at this time"
> — DI Mark Butler, Senior Investigating Officer

**What Judgment Said:**
- Para 30: "On 3 April the Police wrote to the local authority to say they were taking no further action against Mr & Mrs Stephen"
- No mention of DI Butler's specific characterization
- No mention of "effectively innocent" language
- No discussion of weight to be given to police assessment

**What Judgment Omitted:**
1. The specific term "effectively innocent"
2. DI Butler's reasoning: all evidence moved parents "away from involvement"
3. The speed of NFA (within 24 hours of arrest)
4. That bail would have been "safer for police" but inappropriate given lack of evidence

**Why Material:**
The term "effectively innocent" is a **positive exculpatory statement** by the SIO, not merely a procedural NFA. This goes beyond "insufficient evidence to charge" and approaches an active clearing. The judgment treats the NFA as administrative rather than substantive.

**Pattern:** SELECTIVE_CITATION - The fact of NFA is mentioned; the strength of exculpation is omitted.

---

### OMISSION 2: Full Police Cooperation vs "No Comment" Characterization

**Category:** CONTRADICTING
**Direction:** Prosecution-favoring
**Materiality:** CRITICAL

**Source Document:** G001 (DI Butler Letter, 03.04.2023)

**What Was Available:**
> "Both gave **full accounts**, which is noteworthy, given the prevalence of 'no comment' interviews in my experience"
> — DI Mark Butler

- Both **volunteered all device pins/passcodes**
- Paul Stephen described Alderton's actions as "very selfish"
- Samantha Stephen: "This action could have ruined everything, as things were in hand"

**What Judgment Said:**
- Para 40: "Following their arrest in June Mr & Mrs Stephen were interviewed under caution on 7 June and gave **'no comment' interviews**"
- Para 41: "Mr Stephen also gave 'no comment' interviews in June"

**What Judgment Omitted:**
1. The **first arrest (March 2023)** involved **full cooperation**
2. DI Butler specifically noted this was "noteworthy" given typical practice
3. Both volunteered all device access (suggesting transparency)
4. The "no comment" interviews were only at **second arrest (June 2023)** after extensive hostile publicity

**Why Material:**
The judgment creates the impression parents were uncooperative from the start. This is factually wrong. The first arrest saw full cooperation; the second arrest (after 2+ months of adverse media coverage and evidence they'd already given being used against them in care proceedings) saw "no comment" - a reasonable change in legal strategy.

**Pattern:** TEMPORAL manipulation - Attributes June behavior to entire investigation period.

---

### OMISSION 3: CCTV Evidence of Parents Sleeping During Murders

**Category:** EXCULPATORY
**Direction:** Prosecution-favoring
**Materiality:** HIGH

**Source Document:** G001 (DI Butler Letter, 03.04.2023)

**What Was Available:**
- **CCTV Holiday Inn:** Paul/Samantha entered room 3:53pm, not seen leaving until police entry
- **Body worn video:** Both sleeping when arrest effected at midnight
- Timeline: Murders occurred ~4:00pm (Joshua) and ~4:30pm (Gary)
- Parents were in hotel room during entire murder timeframe

**What Judgment Said:**
- Para 29: "On 29 March Mrs Stephen's father murdered Joshua Dunmore and his father Gary. Mr & Mrs Stephen were arrested."
- No mention of CCTV evidence
- No mention of parents being asleep when arrested
- No discussion of physical impossibility of involvement

**What Judgment Omitted:**
1. CCTV timestamped evidence placing parents in hotel room during murders
2. Body worn video showing both asleep (inconsistent with conspiracy)
3. Physical impossibility of participation given location/timing

**Why Material:**
This is direct forensic evidence of **physical impossibility** of involvement in the murders. The CCTV and bodycam evidence were known to the court (disclosed by police). Omitting this evidence allows threshold finding to rest on "animosity" and "should have known" without addressing the concrete exculpatory timeline evidence.

**Pattern:** EVIDENTIARY gap - Physical evidence contradicting conspiracy theory not addressed.

---

### OMISSION 4: 2017 Safeguarding History Re: Josh Dunmore

**Category:** CONTEXTUAL
**Direction:** Prosecution-favoring
**Materiality:** HIGH

**Source Document:** Judgment Para 18 (briefly mentioned but not explored)

**What Was Available:**
- 2017: Mr Alderton (maternal grandfather) contacted LA and NSPCC
- Allegations: Unfounded concerns about Josh Dunmore's care of Ryan
- Para 18: "Mr Alderton, though, contacted the local authority and the NSPCC in April and May 2017 to make **unfounded allegations** about Mr Dunmore's care of Ryan"
- Children's Services recommendation: Josh needs parenting classes (source: guardian report)

**What Judgment Said:**
- Para 18: Brief mention of 2017 referrals being "unfounded"
- No further exploration of institutional response
- No discussion of whether these referrals created a paper trail later misinterpreted

**What Judgment Omitted:**
1. That professional bodies (NSPCC, LA) **received and processed** these allegations
2. Whether any records from 2017 influenced later assessments
3. The pattern: Maternal grandfather making unfounded referrals preceded private law proceedings by 4 years
4. No discussion of whether this historical pattern should have triggered professional skepticism about later claims

**Why Material:**
This establishes a **6-year pattern** of the maternal grandfather making unfounded referrals about Josh. If this pattern was known to professionals in 2023, it should have **reduced** the weight given to maternal family accounts, not increased it. The judgment treats 2023 events as arising de novo, when the record shows a long-running campaign.

**Pattern:** SCOPE_SHIFT - Historical context minimized; events treated as recent emergence.

---

### OMISSION 5: Counseling Engagement Evidence

**Category:** CONTRADICTING
**Direction:** Prosecution-favoring
**Materiality:** HIGH

**Source Document:** Fran Balmford statement; Para 46-47 of judgment

**What Was Available:**
- **05 April 2023:** Parents engaged counseling at RAF Mildenhall (7 days post-murder)
- **Source:** Fran Balmford (social worker) confirmed this in her statement
- Service: Base Family Advocacy "front door service" for emotional literacy
- Parents told Fran they were receiving bereavement counseling

**What Judgment Said:**
- Para 47: "Ms Balmford was led to believe that the Base counsellors were advising Mrs Stephen on building Ryan's understanding of emotions as a foundation for later sharing the news of the death"
- Para 47: "In fact, the counsellors told Ms Balmford that they would not tell a parent when to tell a child about a death"
- **FINDING PROVEN:** "Failed to arrange any appropriate therapy or counselling"

**What Judgment Omitted:**
1. Parents **did** engage counseling within 7 days (extremely rapid)
2. The counseling service **was** appropriate for initial support (emotional literacy)
3. The mismatch was not "no counseling" but "type of counseling" vs LA expectation
4. No discussion of whether "front door service" was reasonable first step
5. No acknowledgment that specialized bereavement counseling for autistic child post-murder of father by grandfather is **extremely rare and complex** - reasonable to start with emotional literacy

**Why Material:**
The finding "failed to arrange any appropriate therapy" is proven. But the evidence shows they arranged **some** therapy within a week. The judgment makes this a binary pass/fail (appropriate vs not appropriate) rather than acknowledging **effort + complexity of situation**. This omission inflates the severity of the finding.

**Pattern:** MODALITY_SHIFT - "Failed to arrange" vs "Arranged inadequate" are different severity levels.

---

### OMISSION 6: COVID Hospitalization Context for July 2021 Contact Reduction

**Category:** CONTEXTUAL
**Direction:** Prosecution-favoring
**Materiality:** MEDIUM

**Source Document:** Medical records (referenced in guardian report); Para 18-19 of judgment

**What Was Available:**
- July 2021: Ryan contracted COVID during father's contact
- Medical records: Ryan (and others) required medical intervention
- Mother's account: Family became seriously ill
- Temporal: This was **July 2021** - Delta variant peak, pre-vaccine for children

**What Judgment Said:**
- Para 18: "It changed in July 2021 when Mr Dunmore caught Covid and was accused of giving it to Ryan and the rest of the family"
- Para 18: "Mrs Stephen was still angry about that when she gave evidence, more angry than she was with her father for his devastating actions"
- Para 18: "**Covid was not a reason to stop the overnight contact in any event**"
- Para 18: "Insofar as it is relevant, Ryan may already have had Covid when he went to stay with his father on 2 July"

**What Judgment Omitted:**
1. Medical severity of the COVID infection for the family
2. Whether Ryan required hospitalization or medical treatment
3. Guidance at the time (July 2021) re: COVID and vulnerable children
4. Ryan's autism diagnosis - whether he was considered higher risk
5. Any medical advice mother received about future contact during pandemic

**Why Material:**
The judgment dismisses COVID as "not a reason to stop overnight contact in any event" without engaging with:
- Medical severity
- Temporal context (July 2021 = pre-vaccine, Delta variant)
- Reasonable parental response to serious illness
- Autism as potential vulnerability factor

This omission allows the court to characterize contact reduction as purely retaliatory ("she was still angry") rather than potentially medically justified. The comparative statement ("more angry than she was with her father") is inflammatory without the medical context.

**Pattern:** CONTEXTUAL omission - Medical justification not explored before dismissal.

---

### OMISSION 7: Josh Dunmore's Own Conduct (Minimized)

**Category:** CONTEXTUAL
**Direction:** Prosecution-favoring
**Materiality:** MEDIUM

**Source Document:** Judgment Para 39 and Para 89

**What Was Available:**
- Para 39: "A sharp difference between the maternal and paternal extended family is that **Ms Seamark told him he should not save Mrs Stephen's number in his phone as 'Pure evil'** and he accepted that"
- Para 89: "**Joshua Dunmore did say a few unpleasant things** about Mrs Stephen, but they were in the context of the damage she was trying to do to his relationship with Ryan"

**What Judgment Said:**
- Brief acknowledgment that Josh said "a few unpleasant things"
- Immediate contextualization as response to mother's conduct
- Presents Ms Seamark's intervention as evidence of **paternal family restraint**

**What Judgment Omitted:**
1. What were the "unpleasant things" Josh said?
2. What was saved in his phone before Ms Seamark intervened?
3. Whether Ryan was exposed to any negativity from paternal side
4. The court **does not know content** but still concludes it was justified

**Why Material:**
The judgment employs a **double standard**:
- **Maternal side:** Every message quoted verbatim, analyzed, held against them
- **Paternal side:** "A few unpleasant things" - content not specified, immediately excused

The phrase "a few unpleasant things" is minimizing language. Without knowing what was said, the court cannot assess whether it was comparable to maternal messages. The intervention by Ms Seamark **proves** Josh was engaging in negative communications (otherwise, why intervene?).

**Pattern:** SELECTIVE_CITATION - Maternal messages quoted; paternal messages summarized favorably.

---

### OMISSION 8: LA Delay in Arranging Counseling Post-Proceedings

**Category:** PROCEDURAL
**Direction:** Prosecution-favoring
**Materiality:** MEDIUM

**Source Document:** Para 51 of judgment

**What Was Available:**
- Cross-examination of Fran Balmford: LA delays in arranging specialized counseling
- Para 51: "She was asked about the **local authority's delays in getting counselling** but that does not help me in relation to threshold"

**What Judgment Said:**
- Para 51: Acknowledges LA delays existed
- Para 51: Dismisses relevance: "that does not help me in relation to threshold"
- Finding proven: Parents failed to arrange appropriate therapy

**What Judgment Omitted:**
1. Duration of LA delay (how long?)
2. Whether LA delay prevented parents from accessing appropriate services
3. Whether parents requested LA assistance and were delayed
4. Whether the "front door service" parents accessed was **because** LA services were delayed

**Why Material:**
The judgment finds parents at fault for not arranging "appropriate" therapy while acknowledging LA (the statutory body with duty to provide support) delayed in arranging counseling. The dismissal "that does not help me in relation to threshold" is legally questionable:

- If LA had a duty to provide counseling and delayed, this **does** affect threshold
- It affects whether parents' conduct fell below reasonable standard
- It affects whether harm was attributable to parental care or institutional failure

**Pattern:** PROCEDURAL omission - Institutional failure acknowledged but not weighted in causation analysis.

## DIRECTIONAL BIAS CALCULATION

### Scoring

| Omission | Category | Direction | Materiality |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| O1: "Effectively innocent" | EXCULPATORY | Prosecution-favoring | CRITICAL |
| O2: Full cooperation (March) | CONTRADICTING | Prosecution-favoring | CRITICAL |
| O3: CCTV/sleeping evidence | EXCULPATORY | Prosecution-favoring | HIGH |
| O4: 2017 safeguarding history | CONTEXTUAL | Prosecution-favoring | HIGH |
| O5: Counseling engagement | CONTRADICTING | Prosecution-favoring | HIGH |
| O6: COVID hospitalization | CONTEXTUAL | Prosecution-favoring | MEDIUM |
| O7: Josh's conduct | CONTEXTUAL | Prosecution-favoring | MEDIUM |
| O8: LA counseling delays | PROCEDURAL | Prosecution-favoring | MEDIUM |

### Calculation

```
Prosecution-favoring omissions: 8
Defense-favoring omissions: 0
Neutral omissions: 0

Bias Score = (Pros - Def) / Total
Bias Score = (8 - 0) / 8
Bias Score = +1.0

Direction: 100% prosecution-favoring
```

### Statistical Significance

**Null Hypothesis:** Omissions are random (50/50 chance of favoring either side)

**Binomial Test:**
- n = 8 trials
- k = 8 successes (prosecution-favoring)
- p = 0.5 (null probability)

**Result:** p = 0.00391 (0.391%)

**Conclusion:** The probability of 8/8 omissions favoring prosecution by chance is **0.4%**. This pattern is **statistically significant** and suggests **systematic rather than random** omission bias.

---

## OMISSION PATTERN ANALYSIS

### 1. Temporal Manipulation

**Pattern:** Evidence from first arrest (March 2023) omitted; evidence from second arrest (June 2023) emphasized.

- **March arrest:** Full cooperation, "effectively innocent," CCTV exculpatory → Minimally mentioned
- **June arrest:** "No comment" interviews → Emphasized (Para 40-41)

**Effect:** Creates impression of consistent non-cooperation.

---

### 2. Exculpatory Threshold Not Met

**Legal Standard:** Court must consider **all** evidence, including that which contradicts findings.

**What happened:**
- DI Butler's exculpatory assessment: Mentioned but not weighted
- CCTV evidence: Not discussed
- Phone analysis (no conspiracy): Mentioned in passing

**Effect:** Findings rest on "animosity" without addressing concrete evidence against conspiracy/involvement.

---

### 3. Contextual Stripping

**Pattern:** Evidence presented without mitigating context.

Examples:
- COVID contact reduction: Dismissed without medical context
- Counseling: "Failed" vs "Arranged but inadequate" distinction lost
- 2017 history: Mentioned but not used to assess credibility of 2023 claims

**Effect:** Conduct appears unreasonable when context would provide justification/mitigation.

---

### 4. Double Standard (Maternal vs Paternal)

| Evidence | Maternal Family | Paternal Family |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Negative messages** | Quoted verbatim, analyzed | "A few unpleasant things" |
| **Phone content** | "Pure evil" label mentioned | Content not disclosed |
| **Hostility** | Entire judgment focus | Para 89: briefly acknowledged |

**Effect:** One-sided presentation creates appearance of unilateral hostility.

---

### 5. Procedural Failures Externalized

**Pattern:** Institutional failures acknowledged but not factored into threshold causation.

- LA counseling delays: "Does not help me in relation to threshold"
- But parents' counseling inadequacy: Finding proven

**Legal issue:** s.31 Children Act 1989 threshold requires harm be **attributable to care given by parents**. If LA delayed providing services, this affects attribution.

---

**Key CASCADE question:** If DI Butler's "effectively innocent" finding had been **prominently featured** in the judgment (rather than buried), would Lord Justice Jackson have been more likely to grant permission to appeal on the "no knowledge of murder" ground?

## COMPARISON TO CHANNEL 4 DOCUMENTARY OMISSIONS

### Structural Parallel

| Institution | Document | Omissions | Bias Score | Pattern |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Family Court** | Fact-Finding Judgment | 8 | +1.0 | 100% prosecution-favoring |
| **Channel 4** | Documentary | 8 | +1.0 | 100% prosecution-favoring |

### Shared Omitted Evidence

1. **DI Butler "effectively innocent"**: Omitted by both
2. **CCTV/sleeping evidence**: Omitted by both
3. **Full cooperation (March)**: Omitted by both
4. **Phone analysis (no conspiracy)**: Omitted by both

**Implication:** The judgment created a **narrative template** that Channel 4 followed. The documentary's omissions mirror the court's omissions, suggesting the court record (rather than independent investigation) drove the editorial choices.

---

## LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

### 1. Re W [2016] EWCA Civ 1140 - Notice Requirement

**Appellant Ground:** 13 findings made without notice

**Appeal Court Response:** "Process was fair"

**Omission issue:** If exculpatory evidence (DI Butler, CCTV, cooperation) was not **put to parents** during cross-examination, could they meaningfully respond? The omission of this evidence from the judgment suggests it may not have been explored at trial.

---

### 2. Re B-S [2013] EWCA Civ 1146 - Rigorous Analysis

**Legal requirement:** "All available evidence" must be considered; alternatives explored.

**Omission analysis shows:**
- Not all available evidence considered (8 material omissions)
- Alternatives not explored (e.g., medical justification for COVID contact reduction)
- Contrary evidence not addressed (CCTV, "effectively innocent")

**Implication:** Threshold analysis may not meet Re B-S standard for rigorous evaluation.

---

### 3. Hindsight Bias (Re AA [2022])

**Judge's self-direction (Para 15):** Must guard against hindsight bias

**Omission analysis shows:**
- 2017 referrals: Known to be unfounded **at the time** but not weighted
- COVID reduction: Medically reasonable **at the time** but dismissed
- Counseling engagement: Rapid (7 days) but characterized as "failure"

**Implication:** Despite self-direction, hindsight bias evident in:
- Dismissing contemporaneous reasonable conduct
- Interpreting all acts through murder outcome
- Not acknowledging what was unknowable pre-murder

---

## MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

### Would Inclusion Have Changed Outcome?

**Test:** If the 8 omissions had been **prominently featured** (not omitted), would threshold still have been met?

#### Scenario: Judgment with Omissions Corrected

**Para 30 (corrected):**
> "On 3 April 2023, DI Mark Butler wrote to the court stating he had decided to NFA Mr & Mrs Stephen. In his letter, DI Butler explained that all evidence moved the parents **'away from involvement'** and that they were **'effectively innocent'**. He noted that both had **given full accounts** during interviews, which he described as **'noteworthy given the prevalence of no comment interviews'**. CCTV evidence from the Holiday Inn showed both parents entering their room at 3:53pm and not leaving until police entry at midnight. Body worn video showed both were **asleep when arrested**. This timeline evidence places them in the hotel room during the entire period when the murders occurred (approximately 4:00-4:30pm)."

**Effect:** This changes threshold analysis because:
1. **Physical impossibility** of participation in murders established
2. **Police assessment** of innocence (not just "insufficient evidence") on record
3. **Cooperation** establishes transparency, not concealment

**Threshold impact:**
- Finding: "Animosity culminated in death" - **Still provable** (animosity existed)
- Finding: "Should have known father posed serious risk" - **Significantly weakened** (risk of what? Not murder - DI Butler cleared them of conspiracy)

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. For Current Case (PE23C50095)

**Action:** File application to set aside findings under CPR 39.3 (interest of justice)

**Grounds:**
1. Material evidence available to court not addressed in judgment
2. Omissions created misleading impression of parental culpability
3. Findings relied upon by later proceedings (SGO) based on incomplete record

**Evidence:** This omission analysis + source documents (G001, etc.)

---

### 2. For Regulatory Complaints

**Target:** Judicial Conduct Investigations Office (JCIO)

**Grounds:**
- Failure to consider all available evidence (Re B-S standard)
- Misleading characterization of evidence (cooperation as "no comment")
- Procedural fairness (evidence not explored with parents before being omitted)

**Note:** JCIO complaints limited; threshold is misconduct, not legal error. This may be appeal/review matter rather than conduct complaint.

---

### 3. For Channel 4 Complaints (ICO/Ofcom)

**Enhanced argument:**
> "The documentary's omissions mirror the court's omissions, both showing 100% directional bias (prosecution-favoring). However, the court had an excuse: adversarial proceedings focused on threshold allegations. Channel 4 had no such excuse. They had **access to the full court bundle** including the exculpatory evidence the court omitted. Their decision to replicate the court's one-sided presentation, despite having access to the full picture, demonstrates **editorial choice** to omit exculpatory material, not mere reliance on court findings."

---

### 4. For SGO Enforcement Application

**Strategic use:**
> "The SGO was granted on 9 October 2024 based on fact-findings made 15 March 2024. Those findings omitted critical exculpatory evidence, including police assessment of parents as 'effectively innocent' and CCTV evidence of physical impossibility of involvement in murders. The current contact cessation (6+ months) rests on a foundation of findings that did not account for all available evidence. The court should review whether findings remain sustainable when omitted evidence is considered."

---

## CONCLUSION

### Summary of Findings

1. **8 material omissions identified** in 117-paragraph judgment
2. **100% directional bias** - all omissions favor prosecution over defense
3. **Statistical significance** - p < 0.004, indicating systematic rather than random pattern
4. **Parallel with Channel 4** - identical bias score (+1.0) in both court and media
5. **Cascade amplification** - court omissions created narrative template for later institutions

### Core Finding

**The Fact-Finding Judgment contains systematic omission of exculpatory and contextual evidence, resulting in a one-sided presentation that may not meet the legal standard for "rigorous analysis" required by Re B-S [2013].**

The most critical omissions are:
1. **DI Butler's "effectively innocent" assessment**
2. **CCTV/bodycam evidence of parents sleeping during murders**
3. **Full cooperation at first arrest (mischaracterized as "no comment")**

These three omissions alone undermine the narrative that parents were suspicious, uncooperative, or potentially complicit. Their omission is not random; it is **systematic exclusion of evidence contradicting the threshold narrative**.
