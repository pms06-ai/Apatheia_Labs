  "task_description": "# Complete Temporal Analysis Engine\n\nImplement the temporal analysis engine to extract, normalize, and analyze dates and time references across documents. Detect temporal inconsistencies, anachronisms, and suspicious timing patterns.\n\n## Rationale\nInstitutional misconduct often involves backdated documents, impossible timelines, and events that couldn't have occurred in the stated sequence. This is a core contradiction type that no competitor addresses systematically. General AI assistants lack the persistent context to track temporal patterns (pain-4-1).\n\n## User Stories\n- As an investigative journalist, I want to automatically detect when a document claims to have been written before events it references so that I can expose backdating\n- As a legal professional, I want to see a timeline of all events across my case documents so that I can identify impossible sequences\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Engine extracts dates from documents with 95%+ accuracy\n- [ ] Relative dates ('three weeks later') converted to absolute where anchor exists\n- [ ] Temporal impossibilities flagged automatically\n- [ ] Integration with timeline visualization in Phase 2\n",
